# Alexcitten

Friendly and sociable programmer with good objective and logical thinking.<br>
I'm passionate about self-development, learning English and having fun :)

## About me

I started by developing Discord bots. Currently I'm developing web3 related bots, using decentralised systems for bot functionality that can do very interesting things in centralised messengers.
I am working on one side of the interaction with the unique smart contracts for the NFT market place.
Despite my young age, I take my work seriously and can easily discuss collaborations, projects, and related topics.
