# Alexcitten

Energetic and approachable coder with a knack for clear, logical thinking. I'm always on the lookout for ways to improve myself, whether it's mastering English and Finnish or exploring new technologies.

My journey started with crafting Discord bots, but I've since delved into the world of web3 and decentralized systems. Now, I'm creating cutting-edge bots that do amazing things within centralized messaging platforms, thanks to decentralized networks.

Currently, my focus is on building an innovative web3 apps on the Arweave native ecosystem. I'm busy developing smart contracts, scripts, and leading marketing efforts for groundbreaking projects.

Despite my age, I bring a mature and professional attitude to my work, backed by a solid educational background. I'm comfortable discussing collaborations, projects, and managing workflows efficiently.

With my diverse skill set and broad range of interests, I bring a unique perspective to my work.
