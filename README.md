# Alexcitten

I thrive on critical thinking and constantly explore new technologies.

My journey started with developing Discord bots, which grew into a passion for Web3 and decentralized systems. I built advanced bots integrated with decentralized networks.

I specialize in JavaScript development for Web3 and bots, as well as creating APIs and SDKs. My work involves writing detailed specifications, designing diagrams, and preparing documents for securing external funding from investors. I also create pitch decks to present ideas clearly.

As the founder of future high-tier Web3 project, I manage both strategic and technical aspects. Currently, Iâ€™m working on a comprehensive project specification, covering architecture, technical requirements, and user flows. This includes whitepapers, technical roadmaps, and legal documents related to intellectual property and partnerships.

Despite my age, I bring a professional and mature approach to every project. I am experienced in managing workflows, collaborating effectively, and ensuring efficient execution.

With a diverse skill set and a fresh perspective, I am ready to make meaningful contributions to any innovative Web3 project.
